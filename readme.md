# Particle shape description through Fourier analysis of 2D images of granular materials

## Directory structure
- project_folder
 * data
 * prog
 * plots

The *project_folder* is the parent folder and the rest are children folders within the project folder. The name of this folder should reflect the sample or as one chooses. The script file resides in the *prog* folder and the data files, in this case
thresholded binary images, should be in the *data* folder. The *plot* folder
will hold the analysis plots and summary. Input images as of now are *.png*.

More to be added to this file.
